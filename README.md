#### Plan of Action
We will analyze the data using regression with a decision tree. The results will be summarized in a table with country, gold, silver, and bronze as our features. The specific country and medal count values will be our examples. Additionaly this can be visaulized with a columnn plot to compare country medal counts. Another visualization will be the a flow chart of the top of our decision tree.  
From our data we plan to target the medal count for each sport which we beleive is related to the athletes physical traits and the country they originate from.
